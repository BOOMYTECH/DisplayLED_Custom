### Manage Custom 7 segment Display using leds
Using this library for Arduino, you will be able to manage a 7-segment display created using LEDs or WS2812 LED strips. If you have built a 7-segment display for example with LED strips, you can define a series of strings that contain the sequence of LEDs for each segment and then use the functions of this library to easily view the digits on the display or the individual segments that compose it
